# PokeMERN

PokeMERN is a Pokemon battle simulator made using NextJS and the PokeAPI.

## Technologies Used

* NextJS (for front-end and server components)
* Tailwind CSS (styling)
* Mongoose (for model creation)
* MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas for database storage)
* GraphQL (schema parsing, using GraphQL Luna)
* PokéAPI (API used to create Pokémon)
* Vercel (deployment)

## Known Bugs

* Enemy Pokemon creation sometimes causes an Apollo error with code 400. 

## Getting Started

Go to the deployed site at https://pokemern.vercel.app/. Sign up for a new account with a username, email, and password. Select your gender, and then select your starter Pokemon.

## How to Play

Your Pokemon can fight using the FIGHT button. You can select from two moves. One will directly hurt the enemy Pokemon, and the other will drop one of their stats. Get creative and battle!

When your Pokemon is low on health, you can go to the ITEM menu to grab a potion. You start the game off with 5 potions, and you can buy more using the points you earn from defeating enemy Pokemon.
